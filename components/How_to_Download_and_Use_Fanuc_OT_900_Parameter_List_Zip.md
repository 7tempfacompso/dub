## What is Fanuc OT 900 Parameter List Zip?
 
Fanuc OT 900 parameter list zip is a compressed file that contains a list of parameters for Fanuc OT controllers. Parameters are settings that control various aspects of the controller's operation, such as spindle speed, feed rate, tool offset, backlash compensation, etc. Parameters can be changed by the operator or programmer to optimize the performance and accuracy of the machine.
 
Fanuc OT 900 parameter list zip is useful for several reasons:
 
- It can help you backup and restore your parameters in case of a power failure, battery loss, or memory corruption.
- It can help you compare and adjust your parameters with other machines or controllers.
- It can help you troubleshoot and diagnose problems with your controller or machine.

## How to Download Fanuc OT 900 Parameter List Zip?
 
Unfortunately, Fanuc OT 900 parameter list zip is not available on the official Fanuc website or any other online source. The only way to get this file is to request it from a Fanuc dealer or service center, or from another user who has it. However, this can be time-consuming and costly, as you may have to pay a fee or wait for a long time to get the file.
 
A better alternative is to create your own Fanuc OT 900 parameter list zip by using a PC and a serial cable. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Connect your PC to your Fanuc OT controller using a serial cable. Make sure the cable is compatible with both devices and has the correct pin configuration.
2. Open a terminal program on your PC, such as HyperTerminal or PuTTY. Set the communication parameters to match your controller's settings, such as baud rate, parity, data bits, stop bits, etc.
3. On your controller, press the SYSTEM key and select PARAMETER (No.6) from the menu.
4. On your PC, type %O followed by Enter. This will initiate the output mode on your controller.
5. On your controller, press the OUTPUT START key. This will start sending the parameter data to your PC.
6. On your PC, save the received data as a text file with a .txt extension.
7. On your controller, press the RESET key to exit the output mode.
8. On your PC, compress the text file using a zip program, such as WinZip or 7-Zip. Rename the file as fanuc\_ot\_900\_parameter\_list.zip.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your own Fanuc OT 900 parameter list zip.
 
## How to Use Fanuc OT 900 Parameter List Zip?
 
Once you have downloaded or created your Fanuc OT 900 parameter list zip, you can use it for various purposes. Here are some examples:

- To backup and restore your parameters, simply reverse the steps above. Instead of typing %O on your PC, type %I to initiate the input mode on your controller. Then send the text file from your PC to your controller using the terminal program. Press INPUT START on your controller to receive the data and update the parameters.
- To compare and adjust your parameters with other machines or controllers, open the text file on your PC using a text editor or spreadsheet program. You can then view and edit the parameters as needed. You can also use a diff tool or a compare function to highlight the differences between two files.
- To troubleshoot and diagnose problems with your controller or machine, open the text file on your PC and look for any abnormal or incorrect values in the parameters. You can also refer to the Fanuc O-T parameter manual[^2^] for more information on each parameter 0f148eb4a0
